    "# DevCloud to Local Migration\n",
    "This tutorial explains the differences between running your IoT application on the DevCloud and in a local environment as well as how to migrate your DevCloud application to your local environment. Because everyone's application has unique requirements, it is intended as a guide and not the definitive reference for doing so.\n",

    "## Understand what the DevCloud does/does not do\n",
    "The Intel DevCloud for the Edge is a useful tool for quickly prototyping, developing and optimizing a new application or importing an existing application and then analyzing the application performance across multiple hardware environments. Since the hardware is in the cloud, it is not necessary to purchase specific hardware on which to run your application until you are closer to deploying it. The DevCloud environment uses consistent interfaces to the AI tools to facilitate being able to deploy on multiple types of hardware. An overview of the DevCloud for the Edge can be found at [here](https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/get_started/devcloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How components of the DevCloud translate to local environments\n",
    "\n",
    "From the illustration below some components of the DevCloud are not present or different in a local execution environment. The circled numbers refer to the DevCloud graphic below. \n",
    "- The HTTP browser❶ access to Development Servers❷ is typically replaced by direct terminal access in your local environment\n",
    "- Your local development machine replaces the Development Servers❷ and the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "- The Storage Server, accessed as `/data` within the Development Server environment, does not exist in your local environment. You will need to provide someplace in your local environment for this data.\n",
    "- The Job Queue❸ is the means within the DevCloud to share access to limited hardware resources❹ in the cloud. Since your local deployment environment will typically have only one hardware resource and dedicated access, the queuing system is not required.\n",
    "- The Inference Video/Image Output❺ will be stored directly to your local machine and the Results❻ will be viewed directly instead of via an HTTP browser.\n",

    "2. The path of the directory where the inference output was written, `local-results`\n",

However, there may still be some localized tweaking you will want to implement. Rather than replicating multiple ideas for further optimization of your application, for considering latency versus batch size, and for other adjustments, the following links provide more information.\n",
